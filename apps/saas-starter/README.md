This is a sample Keel project that demonstrates how to build a Notion clone using Keel using the following features:

- Authentication
- Database
- Rich Text Editor

## Getting Started

The project is built using the following stack:

- [Keel](https://keel.sh)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

To run the project locally, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Deploying to Keel

To deploy the project to Keel, clone the project, copy this directory, turn it into a Git repository, and push it to GitHub. Then, create a new Keel project and select the repository you just pushed to. Keel will automatically detect the project type and deploy it.
